/**
 * PORTED VERBATIM from argus `packages/engine/src/narrative.ts`.
 *
 * The only edit is the import path. Everything else — including every comment —
 * is byte-identical, on purpose: those comments carry findings measured against
 * a recording that cannot be re-created on demand, and they are the reason this
 * file is not "improved". `npm run verify:port` diffs it back against argus.
 *
 * This file is frozen. Matching one launch against a whole corpus rather than
 * against a single parent is a wrapper, and it lives in `match-corpus.ts`;
 * deciding who gets passed in is candidate generation, and that lives in
 * `index-store.ts`. Neither changes anything below.

/**
 * Narrative matching.
 *
 * Decides whether a new launch is a clone of something you hold. Measured
 * against 123 real launches captured on 2026-09-17, which happen to contain a
 * genuine vamp wave: "Thursday Arena" spawned ~25 clones in four minutes with
 * the ticker mutating across THURSDAY, THURSDAYARENA and CUPCAKE while the name
 * stayed recognisable. See `fixtures/README.md`.
 *
 * Two things that sample settled:
 *
 * Normalisation does almost all the work. Matching only on exact equality after
 * normalisation found 6.03 of the 6.14 mean matches that a 0.85 similarity
 * threshold found. The fuzzy layer is worth keeping for a wave that renames more
 * creatively, but it is not what makes this work, and it is not worth tuning.
 *
 * The result is bimodal, which is the real signal. Half of all launches match
 * nothing at all; a wave member matches about twenty-six. The gap between those
 * two states is what a threshold has to sit in, and almost any value does.
